## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Test Debugging
```bash

npm run test -- --reporter=verbose specific-test.ts

# Debug E2E test
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Debug with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Common Issues
1. **Flaky Tests**: Use retry mechanisms and proper waits
2. **Database Conflicts**: Run integration tests serially
3. **Timing Issues**: Use deterministic waits, not arbitrary delays
4. **Memory Leaks**: Clean up resources in afterEach hooks
5. **Rate Limiting**: Reset rate limits between tests

### Test Environment
- Isolated test databases per test suite
- Mocked external services (Redis, WebSocket)
- Deterministic test data generation
- Parallel test execution where safe

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Maintain test isolation and cleanup
5. Update documentation for new test categories

### Test Quality Guidelines
- Tests should be readable and maintainable
- Use descriptive test names and comments
- Group related tests using describe blocks
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Verify both success and failure scenarios

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Test Metrics Tracked
- Test execution time trends
- Flaky test identification
- Coverage trend analysis
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability trends

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass for deployment
- Coverage thresholds enforced
- Performance benchmarks maintained
- Security standards met
- Code quality standards upheld
